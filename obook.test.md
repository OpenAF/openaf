## Introduction

Let's try to add two variables a store the result in a third variable. So we are going to need:

| Variable | Description | Value |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| a        | Holds a value 'a' | 2 |
| b        | Holds a value 'b' | 3 |
| result   | Will wold the result of the value of 'a' plus the value of 'b' | a + b |

## Declaring variables

To start we need to declare the variable 'a' with a value:

````javascript
var a = 2
````

Now we need to declare the variable 'b' with a value:

````javascript
var b = 3
````

## Producing the result

Now let's declare the variable 'result' with it's value being the addition of variable 'a' value with variable 'b' value:

````javascript
var result = a + b
````

## Checking the result

So now let's print the variable 'result' value:

````javascript
result &&
print(result)
````

## Conclusion

And that's it. You can repeat this going back to the beginning and changing variable 'a' and 'b' corresponding values.
